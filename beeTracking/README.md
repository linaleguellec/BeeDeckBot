I took inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/computervisioneng/object-tracking-yolov8-deep-sort.git). 

This project tracks objects using YOLOv8 for identification and deepSort for trajectory tracking. 
My project tracks bees using deepSort but not YOLOv8. 
So I took the structure of this project and replaced the YOLOv8 part of my own method of bee identification. 

      
# Deep Sort

The developer of [this project](https://github.com/computervisioneng/object-tracking-yolov8-deep-sort.git) is working on [this fork](https://github.com/computervisiondeveloper/deep_sort) from deep sort official implementation.
