# General assembly guide 

- Assemble the flight chamber. 
- Remove the floor from the upper part of the cart.  
- First of all, mount the center of the metallic part. The part that links the camera, flight chamber, cart and robotic flower.  This part is mounted like a sanwitch between the upper rails of the carriage. Adjust its position along the length of the cart so that, once the whole structure is assembled, the 4 wheels of the cart support an equivalent weight. 
- Attach the flight chamber to the center of the metal part. 
- Install the 2 largest metal bars separating the flight chamber and the camera. Then install the metal bar that makes these 2 larger bars parallel. 
- Fix the folding feet at the ends of the 2 longest bars. Feet support the weight of the camera.  
- Attach the camera support. 
- Attach the robotic flower under the flight chamber.
