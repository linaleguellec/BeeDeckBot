# General assembly guide 

- Assemble the flight chamber. 
- Remove the floor from the upper part of the cart.  
- First of all, mount the center of the metallic part. The part that links the camera, flight chamber, cart and robotic flower.  This part is mounted like a sanwitch between the upper rails of the carriage. Adjust its position along the length of the cart so that, once the whole structure is assembled, the 4 wheels of the cart support an equivalent weight.

- Attach the flight chamber to the center of the metal part. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape3.jpg)
- Install the 2 largest metal bars separating the flight chamber and the camera. Then install the metal bar that makes these 2 larger bars parallel. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape4.jpg) ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape5.jpg)
- Fix the folding feet at the ends of the 2 longest bars. Feet support the weight of the camera. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape6.jpg)
- Attach the camera support. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape7.jpg)
- Attach the metal bars that will support the robotic flower under the flight chamber. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape8.jpg)
- Attach the robotic flower under the flight chamber. ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape9_1.jpg)  ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/etape9_2.jpg)
- Install the camera on the camera holder ![](https://github.com/linaleguellec/BeeDeckBot/blob/main/imgsForReadMe/final.jpg)
