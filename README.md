# Project presentation 
I completed this project as part of my final year internship as a general engineer specializing in mechanical engineering. 
The aim of the project is to use a single camera to shoot 3D images of bees landing on a moving robotic flower. For more details on the background to this project, please consult my internship report. 

# Folders organization
- beeTracking  : all the algorithms for post-processing the videos (tracing the bee's 3D trajectory from a video in mp4 format). 
- MotorControl : arduino algorithms for motor control.
- robotCAD : the complete digital model of the steel structure in both SolidWorks and STEP formats. 
- technicalDocumentation : all technical documentation (Dynamixel Servomotors, RFID gate ... ). 
- videos : examples of videos taken with the metal structure. The quality of the videos has been reduced to being stored on GitHub.
- results : a summary video of an example of possible results. The quality of the videos has been reduced to being stored on GitHub.

# Comments  

"MotorControl", "robotCAD", "technicalDocumentation and videos" folders are ready to use. You can use them directly for your projects.

Folders "beeTracking" is not yet powerful enough to be used directly in your projects. I therefore advise you to use them as a first step in your research.
